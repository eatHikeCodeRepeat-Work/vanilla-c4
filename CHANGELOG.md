# Changelog

## 1.1.0
Also removing the "message bus / queue" container to be even more true to the original C4 stencils. Updates preview of available elements and REAMDE accordingly.

## 1.0.0
Initial release of a vanilla C4 library / stencil based on the original `hycom-ca` library. Adapted coloring and legend / key to c4model.com style and removed one of the container variants to reduce confusion.
